"""Prompt templates for the deep research system.

This module contains all prompt templatges used across the research workflow components,
including user clarifications, research brief generation and report synthesis.
"""

clarify_with_user_instructions ="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifing question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbrevation or unkown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these quidelines:
- Be consise while gathering all necessary information.
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullets points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarifications": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarifications": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarifications": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification in needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Keep the message concise and professional

"""

transform_message_into_research_topic_prompt = """
You will be given a set of meesages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user.
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanges so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Details
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list the key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When reseach quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather that assumed preferces.
- Example: Instead of assuming " budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarrented Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, contraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope; What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader that users explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregtor sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

research_agent_prompt = """
You are a research assistant conducting research on the user's input topic. For context, today' date is {date}.

<Task>
You job is to use tools to gather information about the user's input topic.
You can use any of the tools provided to you to find resources that can help answer the research question. you can call these tools in series or in parallel, your research is conducted in a tool calling loop.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to two main tools:
1. **tavily_search**: For conducting web searches to gather information
2. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool after each search to reflect on results and plan next steps**
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a human researcher with limited time. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries first
3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?
4. **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - fill in the gaps
5. **Stop when you can answer confidenlty** - Don't keep searching for perfection
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Tool Call Budgets** (Prevent excessive searching):
- **Simple queries**: Use 2-3 search tool calls maximum
- **Complex queries**: Use up to 5 search tool calls maximum
- **Always stop**: After 5 search tool calls if you cannot find the right sources

<Show Your Thinking>
After each search tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:
- What key information did I find?
- What's missing ?
- Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?
- Should I search more or provide my answer?

"""

summarize_webpage_prompt = """ You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. 
Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary wil be 
used by a downstream researh agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identigy and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instruction if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information.
Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:
```
{{
"summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed.",
"key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"}}
```
Here str two examples of good summaries:

Example 1 (For a news article):
```json
{{
"summary":"On July 15, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
"key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference."
}}
```
Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/yearÂ² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports. Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century, warned co-author Professor Michael Green."
